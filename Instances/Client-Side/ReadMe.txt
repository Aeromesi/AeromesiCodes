When patching AeroPatch1.thor or AeroPatch2.thor, first open it inside your GRF editor and edit the GRF name to your servers GRF. Otherwise it will make a WHOLE other GRF...

Example:

It will patch to example.grf

But SHOULD patch to "YourRO.grf", open in GRF editor -> Container Information and edit the GRF the patch will apply to.

Also take contents of "mp3nametable.txt" and "resnametable.txt" and COPY+PASTE into your own "mp3nametable.txt" or "resnametable.txt" DO NOT overwrite your own. As it only contains the information for my instances.
