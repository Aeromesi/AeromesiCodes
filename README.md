# About my repo:
All scripts are made for the Hercules & rAthena emulator software

# Recent updates:
1) Added a close to official Faceworm's Nest script for Hercules
2) Added a close to official Geffen Magic Tournament script for Hercules
3) New folder InstancePacks which contains instances that require more than the the file itself to run correctly (client files, src edits, etc), the neat thing about this folder is it has all the files necessary to work properly. It also gives users choice if they want to download 1 script instead of my whole GitHub repository. Options are important!
4) Fixed Devil's Square type 1 & 2.
5) Updated and simplified installation of custom instances for the Hercules emulator.
6) .mcache files are provided for re/pre-re
7) Fixed ArrayShuffle function (Now Ice Titans attack El Dicastes should be working as well as Fiery Fairy Forest)
