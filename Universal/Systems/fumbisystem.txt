// Fumbi System
// Developed by: Aeromesi // old alias Aeromas
// Enlightenment goes to Grunger for helping me, Kit the Baby Fox for more enlightenment, & Crayu my friend for the idea =P
// Version: 1.7 (4/09/2015)
// Compatible emulator: Hercules
// What it does:
// It's based off the game S4 League, basically you Fumbi a armor or weapon and you get a random armor or weapon.
// After 20 Fumbi's you get the chance to get a card for 10,000,000 If you don't want to fumbi a card, you can decline, but it resets your Fumbi counts
// http://www.s4league.com Try it out!

/* Configuration method:
                                Server Side:
								[1.7 Update]
		Re-worded fumb20 as fumb_attempts for clearer understanding, also had to fix a few errors in Quesophs revision of the script, but still, thank you for helping make this script better!
								[1.6 Update]
		Special thanks to: Quesoph for shortening the script, kept in the label and the sleep2 counters to 2000 so that it simulates the real Fumbi system on S4 League, other then that, have fun!
                                [1.5 Update]
        Just small minor errors, such as the fact I put the cases in wrong numerical order for the Armors... -.-
        Fixed OnInit: was labelled OnInt instead so that array $GodItems actually didn't work, sorry about that!
                                [1.4 Update]
        One less option, Fumbi just says which would you like to try and Fumbi, Weapon or Armor.
        Switched out old/ soon being depreciated commands like menu with switch(select())
        Overall made the script more efficient
                                [1.3 Update]
        .ServName$, for configuring your Server Name in the Fumbi's text
        .fumbirolls variable added for more options, able to choose the MAX Fumbi Roll attempt to whatever you want. [Default Fumbi Roll attempt: 20]
        .ArmChance handles the success rate of which you fumbi an Armor
        .WpnChance handles the success rate of which you fumbi an Weapon
        .wpnfee handles the fee amount for attempting to fumbi an Weapon
        .armfee handles the fee amount for attempting to fumbi an Armor
        .carfee handles the fee amount for attempting to fumbi an Card
        .fname$ = The NPC's name, hence Fumbi
        fumb20 is the variable at which you gain Fumbi points for playing
        Edit the header script to your own map and add in the view ID 10099 for the Fumbi sprite.
                                Client Side:
        What's included is the wav files for the sound effects of the actual Fumbi, and the Sprites of the Fumbi
        There is a still sprite of the Fumbi and a moving sprite of the fumbi, so you can choose what you want to use
        Repack your customgrf.grf with the fumbi.grf, I also left in the raw data for some reason
                                Last but not least, enjoy! */
